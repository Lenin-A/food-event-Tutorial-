<center>   <p>In this video I will explain about Innipu kuli paniyaram detaily in tamil , delightful South Indian snack perfect for satisfying your sweet tooth. These bite-sized treats are traditionally made with fermented rice and lentil batter, similar to idli or dosa batter, but infused with jaggery for a touch of sweetness. The batter is then cooked in a special pan with hemispherical molds, resulting in fluffy and golden paniyaram.There are two main ways to make innippu kuli paniyaram. The first method involves using leftover idli/dosa batter. If the batter is already slightly fermented, you simply need to add melted jaggery, cardamom powder, and a pinch of salt for a quick and easy sweet treat. The other method involves making the batter from scratch using soaked rice, urad dal (black gram lentils), fenugreek seeds, and jaggery. This method requires fermenting the batter for a few hours, but it yields slightly fluffier paniyaram. </p></center>
